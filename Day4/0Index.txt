1) Encapsulation : Class, Object, Instance Variables, Constructors(primary, secondary)
2) Inheritane: super class, sub class,Traits, abstract classes
3) Abstraction : Access specifiers
4) Polymorphism : Constructor overloading, Method overloading, method overrirding, object overloading
5) Companion Object 

Including all these additional concepts in those 5 files: 
    - method overloading with methods of default parameters, 
    - varibale number of parameters(done in Polymorphism), one method with different parameters(done in Polymorphism)
    - create a normal class print the obj, then create a case class and the print the obj.
    - super class, sub class- accessing te methods of eacsh and pasing one refernce into the other object for a abstract class (done in Inheritane)
    - anonomous classes 
    - Traits in scala - lamda suport in trait, abstract, sub classes (done in Inheritance)
    - implement one abstract and one trait class (done in Inheritane)
    - implement a class which inherits multiple traits and a abstract class (done in Inheritance)
    - implicit conversion, implicit classes.  (done in Polymorphism)


case class, anonomous class, companion object
